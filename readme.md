# Overview

This client allows you to type in a Runescape username and see your skills.

**This project is NOT affliated with Runescape or Jagex.**


# Developing
**This project asumes that you have grunt *globally* installed. If this is not the case please execute the following command:**
(*On Unix based systems you need root rights*)

`npm install -g grunt`

During development you should execute `grunt build`. This copies everything from the source to the build folder. I reccomend starting a http-server in the build folder. To autoamate this processes, execute `grunt watch`.

If you want to create your own minified version for production, exectute `grunt dist`.
